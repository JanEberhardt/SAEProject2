# SAEProject2
Software Architecture and Engineering Project 2

TODOS:
- Implement all the simple expr_evaluate cases
- If path is unreachable solver just gives an error: "model is not available", we should just remove the path in this case...
- variable scopes and functions!
- write tons of test-cases (according to pdf one for each possible analysis szenarios...)
